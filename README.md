This is the code for the paper "Benchmarking Multi-Task Learning for Sentiment Analysis and Offensive Language Identification in Under-Resourced Dravidian Languages"

This work is colloborative work by Adeep Hande, Siddhanth U Hegde, Ruba Priyadharshini, Rahul Ponnusamy, Prassana Kumar Kumaresan, Sajeetha Thavareesan,and  Bharathi Raja Chakravarthi.

## [Steps to run Single Task Models:](https://github.com/SiddhanthHegde/Dravidian-MTL-Benchmarking/tree/main/Single%20Tasks)
1) For character BERT, XLM and XLNet run the specific task file and find the string 'read_csv'. Change the path to the dataset where you have stored and run the program on the terminal

2) For other BERT versions and XLMr go to BERT versions and XLMr folder and use train_task1.py for sentiment classification and offensive language detection. Find the string 'read_csv'. Change the path to the dataset where you have stored and run the program on the terminal.

Steps given above can be used for Kannada, Malayalam and Tamil. For custom datasets make sure you have a csv file with 'comment', 'sent', 'off' as the column names and they can be used as well.

## [Steps to run Multi Task Models:](https://github.com/SiddhanthHegde/Dravidian-MTL-Benchmarking/tree/main/Multi%20Tasks)

For Hard Parameter sharing and Soft parameter sharing use the train.py file. Find the string 'read_csv'. Change the path to the dataset where you have stored and run the program on the terminal.
